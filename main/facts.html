		<p style="color:yellow">1-Do you speaking Arabian ?</p> </br>
I heard that things especially while I am using interpals some people asked and they think that Turkish people 
Arabian too once upon a time Ottoman empire controlled Arabian countries and we used arabian alphabeth 
but after Ataturk we use Latin alphabeth but without ''W,Q,'' and we speak Turkish.</br>

</br><p style="color:yellow">2-Do Turkish people play belly dance ? </p></br>
It come from Arabian culture too yeah its very popular in Turkey too these days woman's doing for to lose weight as a sport 
but I think that idea come from eurovision our singers use belly dance in there.</br>

</br><p style="color:yellow">3-I think that you like to eat Turkey ? </p></br>
hahaha its a good joke once upon a time english people find a bird in Turkey and they took it and they said that its name turkey bird than 
when they went to America they saw similiar bird and they said that turkey .</br>

</br><p style="color:yellow">4-Is your capital city Istanbul, isn't it ?</p></br>
Yeah I accept Istanbul is very popular city and many people know there but Istanbul was capital city of Ottoman Empire our capital city is Ankara.</br>

</br><p style="color:yellow">5-Why Turkish man have moustache mostly ?</p></br>
Yeah it can be right but ıt come from out history Ottoman Empire army did not accept a boy without moustache becaue they thought that 
if he did not moustache he is not a man yet and its about religion too but not all Turkish man have moustache because our civil servants have to shave ..</br>

</br><p style="color:yellow">6-Do you live in desert and ride camels ?</p></br>
I think that that idea come from hollywood movies and I think that they never see Turkey and in their fantasy live 
Turkey a big desert and we just have camels, sometimes hollywood is a really important weapon for to perception operation.<br>

</br><p style="color:yellow">7-You are blonde do not look like a Turkish ?</p></br>
Yeah ı m blonde and have colourfull eyes but I am Turkish yeah we are less but it can change regions while we are 
living middle asia our eyes similiar asian too so appereance can change for regions.</br>
</br><p style="color:yellow">8-Turkish man can have 4 wifes ? </p></br>
Turkish civil code do not allow this situation so a man can have a only a wife at law but some man can have a few wife but its unlawful.
They made islamic marriage.</br>

</br><p style="color:yellow">9-How Old Turkish Girls can marry ? </p></br>
I heard a few times some friends asked that Turkish girls marry very early maybe below 18 and child brides.
Maybe it can be right 15 20 years ago about child brides they married 14 ,15 years old but these days 
I dont hear about it because family ministry really good at that subject and they do not allow this situation.
A girl can marry 16 years old if judge and family allow it.</br>
</br><p style="color:yellow">10-Rape rate is high in Turkey ?</p></br>
Rape is really disgusting thing our laws and religion do not allow it.Our female persons can live that situations sometimes 
but that persons take very big punishments.USA, England, Swedish, France, Canada, Germany rape rates are more below from Turkey and 
rape was not a crime until 1980 in France.According to researches 75.000 woman be raped every years.</br>
</br><p style="color:yellow">11-Is Turkey in Middle East ? </p></br>
Anyway ıt s not wrong but incomplete because Turkey is between Asia and Europa and we do not use passport while going Europa part :)</br>
</br><p style="color:yellow">12-Turkish Girls Use Headscarf ?</p></br>
Yeah its about religion some girls use some girls do not use. Turkey is free country about that situation and everybody can wear 
what they want but some place have special rules about dress for example it not good to come in mosque with sexy dress.<br>
